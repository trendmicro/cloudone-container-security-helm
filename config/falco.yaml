# Falco rules files #
#####################

# [Stable] `rules_file`
#
# Falco rules can be specified using files or directories, which are loaded at
# startup. The name "rules_file" is maintained for backwards compatibility. If
# the entry is a file, it will be read directly. If the entry is a directory,
# all files within that directory will be read in alphabetical order.
#
# The falco_rules.yaml file ships with the Falco package and is overridden with
# every new software version. falco_rules.local.yaml is only created if it
# doesn't already exist.
#
# To customize the set of rules, you can add your modifications to any file.
# It's important to note that the files or directories are read in the order
# specified here. In addition, rules are loaded by Falco in the order they
# appear within each rule file.
#
# If you have any customizations intended to override a previous configuration,
# make sure they appear in later files to take precedence. On the other hand, if
# the conditions of rules with the same event type(s) have the potential to
# overshadow each other, ensure that the more important rule appears first. This
# is because rules are evaluated on a "first match wins" basis, where the first
# rule that matches the conditions will be applied, and subsequent rules will
# not be evaluated for the same event type.
#
# By arranging the order of files and rules thoughtfully, you can ensure that
# desired customizations and rule behaviors are prioritized and applied as
# intended.
#
# With Falco 0.36 and beyond, it's now possible to apply multiple rules that match
# the same event type, eliminating concerns about rule prioritization based on the
# "first match wins" principle. However, enabling the `all` matching option may result
# in a performance penalty. We recommend carefully testing this alternative setting
# before deploying it in production. Read more under the `rule_matching` configuration.

# [Stable] `watch_config_files`
#
# Falco monitors configuration and rule files for changes and automatically
# reloads itself to apply the updated configuration when any modifications are
# detected. This feature is particularly useful when you want to make real-time

# [Stable] `time_format_iso_8601`
#
# When enabled, Falco will display log and output messages with times in the ISO

# the /etc/localtime configuration.
time_format_iso_8601: false

# [Stable] `json_output`
#
# When enabled, Falco will output alert messages and rules file
# loading/validation results in JSON format, making it easier for downstream
# programs to process and consume the data. By default, this option is disabled.
json_output: true

# [Stable] `json_include_output_property`
#
# When using JSON output in Falco, you have the option to include the "output"
# property itself in the generated JSON output. The "output" property provides
# additional information about the purpose of the rule. To reduce the logging
# volume, it is recommended to turn it off if it's not necessary for your use
# case.
json_include_output_property: true

# [Stable] `json_include_tags_property`
#
# When using JSON output in Falco, you have the option to include the "tags"
# field of the rules in the generated JSON output. The "tags" field provides
# additional metadata associated with the rule. To reduce the logging volume,
# if the tags associated with the rule are not needed for your use case or can
# be added at a later stage, it is recommended to turn it off.
json_include_tags_property: true

# [Stable] `priority`
#
# Any rule with a priority level more severe than or equal to the specified
# minimum level will be loaded and run by Falco. This allows you to filter and
# control the rules based on their severity, ensuring that only rules of a
# certain priority or higher are active and evaluated by Falco. Supported
# levels: "emergency", "alert", "critical", "error", "warning", "notice",
# "info", "debug"
priority: debug

# [Stable] `buffered_outputs`
#
# Enabling buffering for the output queue can offer performance optimization,
# efficient resource usage, and smoother data flow, resulting in a more reliable
# output mechanism. By default, buffering is disabled (false).
buffered_outputs: false

# [Stable] `outputs`
#
# A throttling mechanism implemented as a token bucket limits the
# rate of falco notifications. This throttling is controlled by the following configuration
# options:
#  - rate: the number of tokens (i.e. right to send a notification)
#    gained per second. Defaults to 1.
#  - max_burst: the maximum number of tokens outstanding. Defaults to 1000.
#
# With these defaults, falco could send up to 1000 notifications after
# an initial quiet period, and then up to 1 notification per second
# afterward. It would gain the full burst back after 1000 seconds of
# no activity.

# [Stable] `log_stderr` and `log_syslog`
#
# Falco's logs related to the functioning of the software, which are not related
# to Falco alert outputs but rather its lifecycle, settings and potential
# errors, can be directed to stderr and/or syslog.
log_stderr: true
log_syslog: true

# [Stable] `log_level`
#
# The `log_level` setting determines the minimum log level to include in Falco's
# logs related to the functioning of the software. This setting is separate from
# the `priority` field of rules and specifically controls the log level of
# Falco's operational logging. By specifying a log level, you can control the
# verbosity of Falco's operational logs. Only logs of a certain severity level
# or higher will be emitted. Supported levels: "emergency", "alert", "critical",
# "error", "warning", "notice", "info", "debug".
log_level: info

# [Stable] `libs_logger`
#
# The `libs_logger` setting in Falco determines the minimum log level to include
# in the logs related to the functioning of the software of the underlying
# `libs` library, which Falco utilizes. This setting is independent of the
# `priority` field of rules and the `log_level` setting that controls Falco's
# operational logs. It allows you to specify the desired log level for the `libs`
# library specifically, providing more granular control over the logging
# behavior of the underlying components used by Falco. Only logs of a certain
# severity level or higher will be emitted. Supported levels: "fatal",
# "critical", "error", "warning", "notice", "info", "debug", "trace". It is not
# recommended for production use.

# [Stable] `output_timeout`
#
# Generates Falco operational logs when `log_level=notice` at minimum
#
# A timeout error occurs when a process or operation takes longer to complete
# than the allowed or expected time limit. In the context of Falco, an output
# timeout error refers to the situation where an output channel fails to deliver
# an alert within a specified deadline. Various reasons, such as network issues,
# resource constraints, or performance bottlenecks can cause timeouts.
#
# The `output_timeout` parameter specifies the duration, in milliseconds, to
# wait before considering the deadline exceeded. By default, the timeout is set
# to 2000ms (2 seconds), meaning that the consumer of Falco outputs can block
# the Falco output channel for up to 2 seconds without triggering a timeout
# error.
#
# Falco actively monitors the performance of output channels. With this setting
# the timeout error can be logged, but please note that this requires setting
# Falco's operational logs `log_level` to a minimum of `notice`.
#
# It's important to note that Falco outputs will not be discarded from the
# output queue. This means that if an output channel becomes blocked
# indefinitely, it indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed by the
# user.
output_timeout: 2000

# [Stable] `syscall_event_timeouts`
#
# Generates Falco operational logs when `log_level=notice` at minimum
#
# Falco utilizes a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to receive
# events, such as system call information, in userspace. However, there may be
# cases where timeouts occur in the underlying libraries due to issues in
# reading events or the need to skip a particular event. While it is uncommon
# for Falco to experience consecutive event timeouts, it has the capability to
# detect such situations. You can configure the maximum number of consecutive
# timeouts without an event after which Falco will generate an alert, but please
# note that this requires setting Falco's operational logs `log_level` to a
# minimum of `notice`. The default value is set to 1000 consecutive timeouts
# without receiving any events. The mapping of this value to a time interval
# depends on the CPU frequency.
syscall_event_timeouts:
  max_consecutives: 1000

# [Stable] `syscall_event_drops`
#
# Generates "Falco internal: syscall event drop" rule output when `priority=debug` at minimum
#
# --- [Description]
#
# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass system
# call information. When Falco detects that this buffer is full and system calls
# have been dropped, it can take one or more of the following actions:
#   - ignore: do nothing (default when list of actions is empty)
#   - log: log a DEBUG message noting that the buffer was full
#   - alert: emit a Falco alert noting that the buffer was full
#   - exit: exit Falco with a non-zero rc
#
# Notice it is not possible to ignore and log/alert messages at the same time.
#
# The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a token
# bucket. The rate corresponds to one message every 30 seconds with a burst of
# one message (by default).
#
# The messages are emitted when the percentage of dropped system calls with
# respect the number of events in the last second is greater than the given
# threshold (a double in the range [0, 1]). If you want to be alerted on any
# drops, set the threshold to 0.
#
# For debugging/testing it is possible to simulate the drops using the
# `simulate_drops: true`. In this case the threshold does not apply.
#
# --- [Usage]
#
# Enabled by default, but requires Falco rules config `priority` set to `debug`.
# Emits a Falco rule named "Falco internal: syscall event drop" as many times in
# a given time period as dictated by the settings. Statistics here reflect the
# delta in a 1s time period.
#
# If instead you prefer periodic metrics of monotonic counters at a regular
# interval, which include syscall drop statistics and additional metrics,
# explore the `metrics` configuration option.

  threshold: .1
  actions:
    - log

# Falco cloud orchestration systems integration #
#################################################

# [Stable] `metadata_download`
#
# When connected to an orchestrator like Kubernetes, Falco has the capability to
# collect metadata and enrich system call events with contextual data. The
# parameters mentioned here control the downloading process of this metadata.
#
# Please note that support for Mesos is deprecated, so these parameters
# currently apply only to Kubernetes. When using Falco with Kubernetes, you can
# enable this functionality by using the `-k` or `-K` command-line flag.
#
# However, it's worth mentioning that for important Kubernetes metadata fields
# such as namespace or pod name, these fields are automatically extracted from
# the container runtime, providing the necessary enrichment for common use cases
# of syscall-based threat detection.
#
# In summary, the `-k` flag is typically not required for most scenarios involving
# Kubernetes workload owner enrichment. The `-k` flag is primarily used when
# additional metadata is required beyond the standard fields, catering to more
# specific use cases, see https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/supported-fields/#field-class-k8s.

# Use gRPC as an output service.
#
# gRPC is a modern and high-performance framework for remote procedure calls
# (RPC). It utilizes protocol buffers for efficient data serialization. The gRPC
# output in Falco provides a modern and efficient way to integrate with other
# systems. By default the setting is turned off. Enabling this option stores
# output events in memory until they are consumed by a gRPC client. Ensure that
# you have a consumer for the output events or leave it disabled.
